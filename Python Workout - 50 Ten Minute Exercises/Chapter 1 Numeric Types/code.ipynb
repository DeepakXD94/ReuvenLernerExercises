    "\n",
    "For this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Write a function (guessing_game) that takes no arguments.\n",
    "2.  When run, the function chooses a random integer between 0 and 100 (inclusive).\n",
    "3.  Then ask the user to guess what number has been chosen.\n",
    "4.  Each time the user enters a guess, the program indicates one of the following:\n",
    "        1.Too high\n",
    "        2.Too low\n",
    "        3.Just right\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  If the user guesses correctly, the program exits. Otherwise, the user is asked to try again.\n",
    "6.  The program only exits after the user guesses correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption : An assumption is made that the user only feeds correct type of input."

(That’s why it takes a list of numbers as its first argument, unlike our mysum implementation.) So sum([1,2,3], 4) returns 10, because 1+2+3 is 6, which would be added to the starting value of 4. Reimplement your mysum function such that it works in this way. If a second argument is not provided, then it should default to 0. Note that while you can write a function in Python 3 that defines a parameter after *args, I’d suggest avoiding it and just taking two arguments--a list and an optional starting point."
